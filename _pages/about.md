I am a first-year PhD student in the [UT Austin Computational Linguistics Group](https://sites.utexas.edu/compling/). I am fortunate enough to be advised by [Kyle Mahowald](https://mahowak.github.io/). I am broadly interested in the interplay of computational language modeling and human cognitive thought and reasoning.

Previously, I graduated from Cornell University Summa Cum Laude, with degrees in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.cornell.edu/), and Computational Cognitive Science (the latter through the [College Scholar Program](https://as.cornell.edu/education/college-scholar-program)). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate enough to work with [Dr. Morten H. Christiansen](https://psychology.cornell.edu/morten-h-christiansen) and [Dr. Eugene Vinitsky](https://www.eugenevinitsky.com/) utilizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to study idiolects in human language. I have also spent time at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories working on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
